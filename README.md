Udemy Python 100 Day Course Problems

I graduated in Software Engineering from the University of Miami in May 2023. 

As I continue my job search, I would like to keep my programming skills sharp. The best way to do so is through practice, and learning every day. 

I am taking a 100 Day Python course on Udemy, and my goal is to never miss a day. 

I am experienced in Python but I am brushing up on my skills, starting from the very beginning.
